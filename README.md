# BurchamKannanSmith_3210_Final
Computer Graphics Final Project

Description:
This is a game of Checkers implemented in javascript with three.js, using models, textures, lighting, user movement, and camera movement. We decided to have the scene look like a run down room with dirty walls and floors as well as have the whole room dark besides one flickering light over the board.
